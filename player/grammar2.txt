Revision 2 (9 April 2010)
-----------------------------

Context-free grammar (using S-expression conventions)
for messages sent from the game-playing program to the
game program.

This grammar is a prototype.  More messages will be
added in future revisions of the game program.

<msg>  ::=  (go <direction>)               ; use only when in a room
         |  (flee)                         ; use only when in a room
         |  (attack <character>)           ; use only when in a room
         |  (attack <character> <weapon>)  ; use only when in a room
         |  (stop)                         ; use only when outside
         |  (enter)                        ; use only when outside
         |  (enter-randomly)               ; use only when outside
         |  (carry <item>)
         |  (drop <item>)

<direction>  ::=  up  |  down  |  east  |  west  |  north  |  south

<character>  ::=  (<stereotype> <strings>) ; must match someone in room

<stereotype>  ::=  <string>

<weapon>  ::=  (weapon <string> <int>)     ; must be a carried item

<item>  ::=  (frog)
          |  (treasure <string> <int>)
          |  (weapon <string> <int>)
          |  (artifact <string>)
          |  (artifact <string> <strings>)

<strings>  ::=  <string>
             |  <string> <strings>
