== Included Files ==
dummy_game.py
game_player.py
game.sps.slfasl
pexpect.py
player.py
README.txt

== Notes ==
The file pexpect.py was not written by us, but is an open source
program which we are using for this assignment.

The file dummy game mimics the game playing program, which we
used for testing out bot on known mazes.

== To run ==
To run:
    python game_player.py -l <path-to-larceny-binary> -g <game-binary>

We do include the file game.sps.slfasl for the game binary

Running:
    python game_player.py -l <path-to-larceny-binary> -g <game-binary> -i
will produce an information log showing the process of our bot in the maze.
